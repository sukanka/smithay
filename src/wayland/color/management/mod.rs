//! Implementation of the wp-color-management-v1 protocol (the stabilized staging version
//! shipped in wayland-protocols).
//!
//! Clients use this protocol to describe the colorimetry of their surface contents (e.g.
//! BT.2020 primaries with the ST 2084 PQ transfer function for HDR video) by creating
//! parametric image descriptions and attaching them to a `wl_surface`. The attached
//! description is double-buffered surface state; the committed value can be read with
//! [`get_surface_description`]. What the compositor *does* with that information (HDR
//! signalling, color conversion, tone mapping) is entirely up to the compositor — see e.g.
//! [`ConnectorColorState`](crate::backend::drm::ConnectorColorState) for signalling HDR on a
//! DRM connector.
//!
//! Only *parametric* image descriptions with *named* transfer functions are supported;
//! ICC-file descriptions are rejected with `unsupported_feature`. The pre-defined
//! Windows-scRGB and Windows-BT.2100 descriptions are available via
//! [`Feature::WindowsScrgb`] / [`Feature::WindowsBt2100`] and are flagged as
//! [`windows_scrgb`](ImageDescription::windows_scrgb) /
//! [`windows_bt2100`](ImageDescription::windows_bt2100), exempting them from any tone mapping
//! the compositor performs. The compositor chooses which transfer functions, primaries, features
//! and rendering intents to advertise when creating the
//! [`ColorManagementState`]. Mastering display metadata
//! (target color volume) is supported via [`Feature::SetMasteringDisplayPrimaries`], including
//! target volumes exceeding the primary color volume via [`Feature::ExtendedTargetVolume`];
//! without the latter, such descriptions fail gracefully as the protocol recommends.
//! Source image description primaries may also be set to arbitrary values via
//! [`Feature::SetPrimaries`].
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Implement [`ColorManagementHandler`], create a [`ColorManagementState`] and route the
//! protocol objects with the crate-wide [`delegate_dispatch2!`](crate::delegate_dispatch2)
//! macro. In your rendering/output logic, read the committed description of relevant
//! surfaces with [`get_surface_description`].
